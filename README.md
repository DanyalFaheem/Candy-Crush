# Candy-Crush
Candy Crush game playable with Mouse clicks made using Glut Library in C++

Use the mouse to click and drag the gems. 

The H button gives you a hint about matching gems.

The longer row of gems you match, the more points you gain.

If there is no 3 or more matching gems, then gems won't swap and moves will be wasted.

At each level, the amount of score required increases.
